[Geoffrey Lit](https://www.geoffreylitt.com) has an great demonstration of building a React web app using ChatGPT in a matter of minutes.

One the initial code is generated:

> I’m not going to read it. I just copy and paste and go.

Whoa! We’re just going to take this code, generated by some black box LLM, for
us and run it? That actually makes sense.

Generating code in this scenario is more like downloading an app for my phone. I don’t do a full code review before opening the app. I download it, try it out, and see if it fits my needs.

Generating a small app with ChatGPT is the same. We’re asking ChatGPT to solve a task. The code is just an intermediate step.
