> Love Livebook, but want to write .exs files? Livescript runs your .exs files in an iex shell, and reruns them on change. The key is that it doesn't rerun the whole file, only the parts that changed. Just like Livebook stale tracking, though admittedly simplified.

Looks handy for prototyping and when things are getting too complicated for . Like running  but without needing the test case scaffolding.
