> [Electric](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric) provides an [HTTP API](https://next.electric-sql.com/api/http) for syncing [Shapes](https://next.electric-sql.com/guides/shapes) of data from Postgres.

Replicates changes from postgres. Use the electric typescript client to sync data to your browser application. It uses a concept called Shapes to specify what data should be synced. The sync service is written in Elixir.

Looks like a good option for "I need Postgres on the server, but something like Firebase in the web client"
