> Bare metal to production ready in mins; your own fly server on your VPS. - MightyMoud/sidekick

Looks similar to [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org) (listed under inspiration, along with [Fly.io](https://fly.io)).

The docs include sections explaining what each command does:

> What does Sidekick do when I run this command
> * Build your docker image locally for linux
> * Compare your latest env file checksum for changes from last time you deployed your application.
> * If your env file has changed, sidekick will re-encrypt it and replace the encrypted.env file on your server.
> * Deploy the new version with zero downtime deploys so you don't miss any traffic.

That's a nice way of explaining what is going under under all the abstraction.
