Another example of a flow-based programming environment. Based on
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/), and there are
[Elixir helpers available](https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-red-elixir-helpers).

There are acceptance nodes, too, which are used for unit testing:
flows can be created and verified they work as expected. This is worth exploring more as testing is often
an overlooked challenge with visual programming environments.
